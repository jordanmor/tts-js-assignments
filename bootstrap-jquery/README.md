Lab/Homework Instructions  
- Look at the list of components on the Bootstrap documentation, pick out a few of the components and code some simple sections
- Using div sections, create several message areas that have different background colors. Reference the bg- series of classes
- Use `<p>` tags and the text- classes to create several areas of colored text
- Combine the bg- and text- classes to make some custom alert-like sections
- (Table One) Create a basic table using `<div>` sections. Create simple custom border styles or use the built-in Bootstrap border classes and apply them alternating in each column.
- (Table Two) Add adaptive sizing. Change the col- classes to col-md- on various rows. Resize the browser and observe the behavior. Using the .offset classes, create a row that has space to the left and all the column content shown to the right.
- Create an input form using the form-group and form-control classes and add a primary button to the form.

<strong>Instructions used to create Grid X</strong>
