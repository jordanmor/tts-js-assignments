**Lab/Homework Instructions**   
Build a simple Angular app using routing, services, dependency injection, observables, forms and animation.   
- Create several components, modify the html templates to display something other than the default message, create a route for each new component and add a tag/link that goes to the page.
- Create and style pages links, either as horizontal or vertical items so they resemble a menu
- Make one of the components serve as the application default. Give it some additional "Welcome to the site" verbiage and make it the default route in the routing system.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
